        question: "What's your typical delivery timeline?",
        answer: "We usually deliver the first version within 5–7 days. Final delivery depends on the scope, but most websites are completed within 2 weeks, including feedback and edits.",
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "How do we stay in touch during the project?",
        answer: "We use async communication through Slack, WhatsApp, or email — whatever you're most comfortable with. This helps us stay focused on building your website while keeping you in the loop at all times.",
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "How does your process work?",
        answer: "It starts with you telling us what you need — either through a message or a call (if you prefer one). After that, we move into planning, designing, building, and reviewing together. You’ll be involved throughout, and we’ll make sure the final result feels *very you*.",
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "What if I’m not happy with the design?",
        answer: "We’ll work closely with you and iterate till you're 100% satisfied. Your feedback is the heart of the process, and we’re super flexible when it comes to changes and refinements.",
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Do you offer refunds?",
        answer: "If we haven’t started working yet, yes — no worries. Once the work begins, our team’s time and effort are already invested, so we don't offer refunds after that point.",
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "What tech stack do you use?",
        answer: "We mostly work with Next.js and Tailwind CSS — because they're fast, modern, and SEO-friendly. But we’re open to other stacks too if your project calls for it!",
    },
    {
        id: 7,
        question: "Can we have calls or Zoom meetings?",
        answer: "We try to keep things async to stay laser-focused on your project. That said, if something’s better explained over a quick call, we’re open to it. But mostly, we communicate via chat, updates, and shared docs.",
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: "What if I need updates after the site is live?",
        answer: "You’ll get a short video guide to help you make basic changes. For anything advanced, we offer paid support or monthly retainers — so you’re never stuck with a broken or outdated site.",
    },
